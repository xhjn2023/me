# Test-Driven Development

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means. The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation. This produces crap tests.

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test → one implementation → repeat.

## Workflow

### 1. Planning
- Confirm with user what interface changes are needed
- Confirm which behaviors to test (prioritize)
- Design interfaces for testability
- List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps)
- Get user approval on the plan

### 2. Tracer Bullet
Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system:
```
RED:   Write test for first behavior → test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass → test passes
```

### 3. Incremental Loop
For each remaining behavior:
```
RED:   Write next test → fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass → passes
```

Rules:
- One test at a time
- Only enough code to pass current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

### 4. Refactor
After all tests pass:
- Extract duplication
- Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- Run tests after each refactor step
- Never refactor while RED — get to GREEN first

## Checklist Per Cycle

```
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive internal refactor
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
```
